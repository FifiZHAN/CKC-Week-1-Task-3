      "body": "I am born and raised in NYC, specifically in downtown Brooklyn. I am the oldest in my family, including both my parent's side of the family, which is something I wish I could change. I am a homebody; I love staying indoors. My family, however, loves to go outdoors and hates the idea of staying indoors all day, so I often get dragged outside with them, which made me hate going outside as I grew up. As you can probably tell, I am a family-oriented person. I developed an interest in hobbies like reading, gaming, drawing, etc, or just anything that lets me stay at home. I also love to eat, and some of my favorite foods include sushi, macaroons, ice cream, carrots, and any type of noodles. I also don't like anything that tastes sour, but I love anything sweet, although ironically, I don't like most types of candy. I have also been to multiple countries like UK, China, and Vietnam before the pandemic hit. I haven't gone anywhere since 2020 and have been too busy to travel anywhere for an long period of time. But I do hope to be able to visit my out-of-country family soon. ",
